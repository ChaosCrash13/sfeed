v0.9
====

Features:
---------

	* Feeds are now by default updated in parallel for an increase in performance.
	* Auto-detect XML character set encoding (sfeed_xmlenc).
	* Find RSS/Atom feeds from web-pages (sfeed_web).
	* Added sfeed_frames, a formatting program to output feeds as a HTML file with
	  frames. It's optimized to look good in older browsers that don't necesarily
	  support CSS or modern HTML, like links. See the man page for more details.
	* Removed the dependency on libexpat, using a custom XML parser (xml.*),
	  this parser is also non-validating, it will not check the XML for errors
	  or stop parsing if it contains errors (which is good).

Bug fixes:
----------

	* Parsing datetime strings containing timezone suffix to UNIX timestamps
	  was wrong. UNIX timestamps are in GMT+0 time. For simplicity sake output
	  parsed datetime strings in a formatted manner without converting the
	  time to the user selected timezone (YYYY-mm-dd HH:mm:ss TZ([-+]offset?).
	* Also when determining if an item is new (by comparing the UNIX
	  timestamp) don't take into account timezones, because setenv(TZ,...) is
	  just ugly and I don't use it.
	* Lots of small fixes for compatibility with RSS / Atom feeds.
	* Many more improvements, I'll keep a more detailed list in the feature.
